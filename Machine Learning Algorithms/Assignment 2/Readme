The code is written in python 3.5.2.

The report is in main.pdf.

There are three folders :

code : Contains Professor White's Code.It acts as an interface to my algorithms Also, Ridge regression is implemented inside regressionalgorithms.py.

figures: Figures created during the analysis.

Solutions: Contains my solutions to the question. The file name is in the format of 

solve_<question part>.py. Each of these file should be run independently and each script will give you answer to the corresponding question. 

Please check Solutions/import_files.py for any import error.

Note: Make sure that code and solutions be in same folder as my solutions are dependend on professor's code.
